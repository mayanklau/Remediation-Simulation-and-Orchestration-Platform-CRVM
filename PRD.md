# Product Requirements Document: EY CRVM Remediation Twin React + FastAPI

## 1. Product Summary

**Product name:** EY CRVM Remediation Twin

**Category:** Continuous risk and vulnerability management, app posture, remediation simulation, orchestration, and agentic governance platform

**Stack:** React, Python FastAPI, MongoDB

**Purpose:** Help enterprises turn discovery, app posture, exposure, and scanner findings into prioritized, chained, simulated, approved, auditable remediation work with CRVM scoring, vulnerability-chain analytics, virtual patching, attack-path breakers, and governed agentic planning.

## 2. Problem Statement

Enterprises have many tools that detect risk but few systems that safely coordinate remediation. Vulnerability scanners, cloud security tools, IAM analyzers, code scanners, Kubernetes platforms, and compliance systems produce overlapping findings. Teams struggle to decide what matters, who owns it, what will break if remediated, whether a compensating control is safer, and what evidence is needed.

The result is duplicated tickets, delayed fixes, risky production changes, weak audit trails, and low trust between security and engineering.

## 3. Goals

- Provide a full-stack remediation platform using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB.
- Complete the loop from app-posture discovery to remediation using concepts ported from `app-posture.zip`.
- Add CRVM scoring for app posture, vulnerability discovery, CIA/environment risk, cyber-risk economics, exposure intelligence, and compromisability.
- Add SSO/OIDC, tenant isolation tests, and RBAC enforcement contracts on sensitive routes.
- Separate API routes from service, repository, DTO, and shared validation contracts.
- Add queue workers for ingestion, simulation, connector sync, evidence generation, report snapshots, post-remediation validation, and data-quality scans.
- Add manual connector and integration onboarding for arbitrary scanners, CMDB, ticketing, cloud, code, IAM, notification, app-posture, and custom HTTP providers.
- Add a once-and-for-all enterprise readiness control catalog with implemented, contract-ready, and external-setup-required status.
- Add production expansion modules for onboarding, connector marketplace, data quality, validation, economics, drift, policy builder, plugin SDK, deployment, security review, executive reporting, demo separation, E2E testing, CRVM posture, and data residency.
- Add a go-live kit covering production environment values, production compose, launch sequence, rollback sequence, CRVM checks, and acceptance checks.
- Add production effectiveness controls for queue retries, dead letters, idempotency, source freshness, owner coverage, evidence completeness, post-remediation validation, and observability alerts.
- Add environment separation for local, dev, staging, and production with strict config validation.
- Ingest and normalize findings from multiple enterprise sources.
- Map findings to assets and business context.
- Connect app posture, asset exposure, and cyber-risk economics to remediation action prioritization.
- Construct graph-native scanner-normalized vulnerability chains and attack paths.
- Generate multiple attack paths from each discovered vulnerability and show impact score, pre-remediation risk, and post-remediation residual risk on every graph point.
- Add advanced cyber-risk intelligence for exploit fusion, business-service impact, attack-path confidence, exposure management, adversary scenario simulation, risk appetite, control coverage, toxic-combination detection, kill-chain staging, regulatory mapping, security debt, dynamic SLAs, change-risk modeling, remediation strategy selection, control-effectiveness validation, threat-informed prioritization, crown-jewel governance, exception governance, campaign intelligence, continuous validation, scanner trust scoring, playbook marketplace, risk economics, and executive narratives.
- Prioritize by technical and business risk.
- Score attack-path difficulty and before/after remediation risk.
- Simulate remediation before change.
- Generate rollout, rollback, validation, and evidence plans.
- Route high-risk work through approvals.
- Recommend virtual patches and attack-path breakers.
- Enable agentic planning with any LLM, SLM, model gateway, or deterministic fallback.
- Keep live execution governed and dry-run by default.
- Preserve audit logs and report snapshots.

## 4. Non-Goals

- Replace scanners, SIEM, SOAR, ITSM, or CI/CD systems.
- Execute production changes without credentials, approvals, rollback plans, and evidence gates.
- Store raw secrets in application data.
- Treat model output as authoritative execution permission.

## 5. Target Users

- CISO and security leadership
- Vulnerability management teams
- Cloud security teams
- IAM and identity teams
- Platform engineering
- Application security
- GRC and audit teams
- Change managers
- Service owners

## 6. Core User Journeys

### 6.1 Ingest Findings

Users can ingest findings through JSON or prototype ingestion. The system normalizes each finding, maps or creates an asset, calculates risk, deduplicates by fingerprint, and creates a remediation action for each new canonical finding.

### 6.2 Review Enterprise Risk

Users can open the dashboard to see counts, open findings, assets, remediation actions, simulations, total business risk, and simulation coverage.

### 6.3 Simulate Remediation

Users can simulate a remediation action to estimate confidence, risk reduction, operational risk, approval requirement, and rollback requirement.

### 6.4 Generate a Plan

Users can generate remediation plans with rollout steps, rollback steps, validation steps, and evidence requirements.

### 6.5 Route Approval

Users can create approval workflows with security owner, service owner, and CAB-style approvals.

### 6.6 Apply Virtual Patching

Users can identify exposed, high-risk, or unpatchable findings and activate dry-run virtual patch policies.

### 6.7 Analyze Vulnerability Chains

Users can open Attack Paths to see scanner-normalized chains from exposed entry points to production or crown-jewel targets. Each path shows difficulty, before-remediation risk, after-remediation residual risk, recommended breakers, and scanner sources.

### 6.8 Run Agentic Planning

Users can run an agentic plan using a configured LLM, SLM, model gateway, or deterministic fallback. The agent returns a governed plan with tool steps and safety rails.

### 6.9 Add Any Connector

Users can create a manual connector profile, select a template or define a custom provider, store endpoint metadata and secret references, and run a dry-run health check before enabling live integration work.

### 6.10 Review Enterprise Readiness

Users can review the complete enterprise control catalog across identity, tenancy, secrets, connectors, ingestion, analytics, simulation, remediation, AI governance, evidence, operations, testing, deployment, product experience, CRVM posture, and commercial packaging.

### 6.11 Operate Product Completeness

Users can review production expansion modules with owners, API surfaces, workflows, readiness gates, and evidence outputs for the remaining enterprise and CRVM capabilities.

### 6.12 Launch Production

Users can review go-live requirements, launch sequence, rollback sequence, CRVM checks, and acceptance checks so deployment teams only need to provide customer-specific values.
