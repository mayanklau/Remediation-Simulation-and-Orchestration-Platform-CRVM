# EY CRVM Remediation Twin: React + Python FastAPI + MongoDB

EY CRVM Remediation Twin is an enterprise continuous risk and vulnerability management platform that combines app-posture discovery, exposure analytics, attack-path simulation, remediation orchestration, and evidence governance in a React frontend, Python FastAPI backend, and MongoDB persistence layer.

The platform helps enterprises move from discovery to remediation without losing context. It ingests findings from scanners, cloud security tools, IAM platforms, Kubernetes, code security, compliance systems, ticketing tools, and app-posture sources; maps them to assets; computes CRVM app posture, CIA/environment score, vulnerability discovery score, CRQ/ROSI economics, vulnerability chains, and attack paths; simulates remediation; generates rollout and rollback plans; routes approvals; applies virtual patches and attack-path breakers; and records audit evidence.

## Why This Exists

Enterprises usually have many detection tools but no trusted system of action. Vulnerability management, cloud security, identity, application security, and GRC teams all create overlapping work. Engineering teams then receive tickets without clear blast radius, ownership, rollback guidance, approval context, or evidence requirements.

EY CRVM Remediation Twin creates a governed operating layer for:

- deciding which findings matter most
- connecting app-posture discovery and exposure analytics to remediation execution
- mapping findings to real assets and business services
- scoring app posture with CRVM formulas inspired by the imported `app-posture.zip`
- simulating remediation before production change
- reducing risk with virtual patching when permanent remediation is delayed
- breaking risky attack paths before a full fix is safe
- routing human approvals for high-risk work
- generating evidence for audit and leadership reporting
- using agentic planning without allowing uncontrolled execution

## Core Application Flow

1. A tenant is resolved from `x-tenant-id` or a default tenant is created.
2. Findings are ingested through JSON or prototype ingestion.
3. Assets are upserted from finding payloads.
4. Findings are fingerprinted and deduplicated.
5. Technical risk and business risk are calculated.
6. A remediation action is generated for each new canonical finding.
7. Users simulate remediation to estimate risk reduction and operational risk.
8. Users generate rollout, rollback, validation, and evidence plans.
9. Users create approval workflows for governed execution.
10. Attack-path analytics chain vulnerabilities from exposed entry points to production or crown-jewel targets.
11. Cyber-risk intelligence explains exploit probability, adversary scenarios, business-service exposure, path confidence, toxic combinations, regulatory obligations, dynamic SLAs, remediation economics, exceptions, validation, and executive narratives.
12. Virtual patching recommends compensating controls and path breakers.
13. Agentic planning creates a governed tool plan with dry-run defaults.
14. Manual connector profiles onboard arbitrary third-party systems and run dry-run checks before live execution.
15. Enterprise readiness maps every required control to implemented, contract-ready, or external-setup-required status.
16. Production expansion tracks the remaining enterprise product modules with APIs, workflows, evidence, gates, and owners.
17. Production effectiveness verifies queue reliability, data quality, validation loops, evidence sealing, and observability.
18. Go-live checks guide the final customer deployment and rollback path.
19. Reports and audit logs preserve decision history.

## Attack Path Analytics

Advanced analytics coverage:

- shortest exploitable path, k-hop blast radius, crown-jewel exposure, choke-point, and path-breaker scoring
- chaining rules for network, IAM, cloud, Kubernetes, application, CI/CD, secrets, and data-store findings
- exploit preconditions for privilege, network access, user interaction, token scope, and lateral movement
- before/after simulation by control type: patch, WAF/API rule, IAM deny, segmentation, container rebuild, and cloud policy
- executive views for business services at risk, risk reduced, blocked remediations, and attack paths closed

The `/api/attack-paths` backend and Attack Paths UI convert scanner findings into end-to-end vulnerability analytics:

- normalizes Tenable, Qualys, Wiz, Snyk, GitHub Advanced Security, AWS Security Hub, Kubernetes, IAM, cloud posture, compliance, CSV, and API findings into chain steps
- uses asset reachability, internet exposure, exploit availability, active exploitation, patchability, policy controls, and production/crown-jewel targeting
- builds bounded logical attack paths from likely entry points to high-value targets
- returns graph-library-ready attack path nodes and edges for entry assets, reachable services, exploit preconditions, targets, and breaker controls
- renders a React Flow Attack Path Graph UI that makes path traversal and risk transfer visible
- renders a Vulnerability Chaining Graph UI that shows ordered exploit steps, scanner source, mapped technique, difficulty, before/after risk, and breaker impact
- labels path difficulty as `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, or `VERY_HIGH`
- compares before-remediation risk with estimated after-remediation residual risk
- recommends virtual patches, microsegmentation, conditional IAM denies, route restrictions, and simulation-backed path breakers
- snapshots the analytics into report and audit records

### Maturity Additions

The React/FastAPI/MongoDB version now includes the same enterprise maturity layer:

- scanner-family coverage for vulnerability scanners, cloud posture, code security, IAM, network/Kubernetes, and compliance inputs
- asset-mapping, exploit-signal, and remediation-signal coverage percentages so weak data is visible before customers trust an attack path
- decision-readiness metrics for customer-ready paths, executive escalations, average difficulty, likelihood, business impact, and release confidence
- subject-maturity checks for scanner normalization, reachability, exploit preconditions, before/after residual risk, path difficulty, breaker controls, evidence, and validation
- development-maturity gates for tenant-scoped access, deterministic graph contracts, policy guardrails, simulation evidence, explainability, and audit snapshots
- per-path evidence requirements, validation steps, and a customer-facing before/after risk narrative

## Agentic LLM and SLM Support

The agentic layer is model-agnostic. It can use external models when configured, but it always has a deterministic fallback so the platform remains usable in regulated, offline, or demo environments.

| Provider | Environment |
| --- | --- |
| Deterministic fallback | Always enabled |
| OpenAI-compatible gateway | `LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_API_KEY`, `LLM_MODEL` |
| Anthropic-compatible | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` |
| Gemini-compatible | `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_MODEL` |
| Local SLM | `LOCAL_SLM_URL`, `LOCAL_SLM_MODEL` |

Agentic safety rules:

- Model output is advisory.
- Live execution remains dry-run by default.
- Production assets require simulation, approval, rollback, and evidence.
- Raw secrets are not sent to prompts.
- Deterministic policy gates control execution eligibility.
- Agent plans are stored as report snapshots and audit events.

## Production Readiness

The application includes the foundations expected for an enterprise pilot:

- tenant-scoped APIs
- MongoDB indexes for important query and uniqueness paths
- dry-run connector and worker contracts
- security headers
- rate-limit middleware
- risk scoring
- simulation and rollback modeling
- approval workflow creation
- virtual patching and path breaker planning
- vulnerability chaining and before/after attack-path risk
- agentic model fallback
- audit logging
- reports
- Docker Compose
- backend tests
- frontend build pipeline

For live production deployment, add managed MongoDB, external secret manager, enterprise SSO, immutable object storage for evidence, queue-backed workers, OpenTelemetry tracing, alert routing, centralized rate limiting, and organization-specific governance policies.

## Current Execution Policy

Live execution is intentionally disabled by default. The platform records dry-run connector and worker operations until production credentials, approval policies, change windows, rollback plans, and evidence storage are configured.
